# Operators
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator we require arithmetic operators.
# Arithmetic operators


|   Operator             |Operator Name                          |Example                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|+|`Addition`            |``` 15+7 ```            |
|-|`Subtraction`            |``` 15-7 ```            |
|*|`Multiplication`            |``` 5*7 ```            |
|**|`Exponential`            |``` 5**3 ```            |
|/|`Division`            |``` 5/3 ```            |
|%|`Modulus`            |``` 15%7 ```            |
|//|`Floor Division`            |``` 15//7 ```            |

## Note :
Expontial (5**3) = 5X5X5 = 125

Modulus means remainder of the division
