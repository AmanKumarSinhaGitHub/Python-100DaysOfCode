# Magic/Dunder Methods in Python

Magic methods, also known as "dunder" methods (short for double underscore), are special methods in Python that provide a way to customize the behavior of your classes. These methods are automatically invoked in response to specific operations or actions, making your code more powerful and flexible. Let's explore some of the most commonly used magic methods in Python with examples.

## `__init__` Method

The `__init__` method is a constructor that is called automatically when you create a new instance of a class. It initializes the object's attributes and sets up its initial state.

Example:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create a Person object
person = Person("Alice", 30)
```

## `__str__` and `__repr__` Methods

The `__str__` and `__repr__` methods are used to provide string representations of objects. The `__str__` method is intended for human-readable output, while the `__repr__` method is meant to create a string that, when evaluated, can recreate the object.

Example:

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

point = Point(3, 4)
print(str(point))  # Output: Point(3, 4)
print(repr(point)) # Output: Point(3, 4)
```

## `__len__` Method

The `__len__` method allows you to define the length of an object, which is especially useful for custom data structures like lists or dictionaries.

Example:

```python
class MyList:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

my_list = MyList([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(len(my_list))  # Output: 5
```

## `__call__` Method

The `__call__` method enables you to make an object callable like a function. When an object is called, this method is executed.

Example:

```python
class Multiplier:
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, x):
        return self.factor * x

double = Multiplier(2)
result = double(5)  # Equivalent to calling double.__call__(5)
print(result)  # Output: 10
```

These are just a few examples of the many magic methods available in Python. They empower you to customize and enhance the behavior of your classes, making your code more expressive and readable. Explore and utilize these methods to take your Python code to the next level.
