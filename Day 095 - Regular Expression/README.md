# Regular Expressions in Python
Regular expressions, or "regex" for short, are a powerful tool for working with strings and text data in Python. They allow you to match and manipulate strings based on patterns, making it easy to perform complex string operations with just a few lines of code.
## Metacharacters in regular expressions

[]  Represent a character class
^   Matches the beginning
$   Matches the end
.   Matches any character except newline
?   Matches zero or one occurrence.
|   Means OR (Matches with any of the characters
    separated by it.
*   Any number of occurrences (including 0 occurrences)
+   One or more occurrences
{}  Indicate number of occurrences of a preceding RE 
    to match.
()  Enclose a group of REs



# Metacharacters in Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. In Python, the `re` module provides support for regular expressions. This README provides an overview of commonly used metacharacters in regular expressions and additional metacharacters available in Python.

## Common Metacharacters in Regular Expressions:

1. **Character Class `[]`**:
   - Represents a character class. Matches any character within the brackets. For example, `[aeiou]` matches any vowel.

2. **Caret `^`**:
   - Matches the beginning of a line or string.

3. **Dollar Sign `$`**:
   - Matches the end of a line or string.

4. **Period `.`**:
   - Matches any character except newline.

5. **Question Mark `?`**:
   - Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding character.

6. **Pipe `|`**:
   - Means OR. Matches with any of the characters separated by it.

7. **Asterisk `*`**:
   - Matches any number of occurrences (including 0 occurrences) of the preceding character.

8. **Plus `+`**:
   - Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character.

9. **Curly Braces `{}`**:
   - Indicates the number of occurrences of a preceding RE to match. For example, `a{2,4}` matches 'aa,' 'aaa,' or 'aaaa.'

10. **Parentheses `()`**:
    - Enclose a group of REs, allowing you to apply operators to the entire group.

## Additional Metacharacters in Python's `re` Module:

11. **Backslash `\`**:
    - Marks the next character as either a special character or a literal. For example, `\n` matches a newline character.

12. **Backslash and Digit `\d`**:
    - Matches any digit character (equivalent to `[0-9]`).

13. **Backslash and Non-Digit `\D`**:
    - Matches any non-digit character (equivalent to `[^0-9]`).

14. **Backslash and Whitespace `\s`**:
    - Matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.

15. **Backslash and Non-Whitespace `\S`**:
    - Matches any non-whitespace character.

16. **Backslash and Word Character `\w`**:
    - Matches any word character, including letters, digits, and underscores (equivalent to `[A-Za-z0-9_]`).

17. **Backslash and Non-Word Character `\W`**:
    - Matches any non-word character.

## Importing re Package
In Python, regular expressions are supported by the `re` module. The basic syntax for working with regular expressions in Python is as follows:

```python
import re
```

## Searching for a pattern in re using re.search() Method
re.search() method either returns None (if the pattern doesnâ€™t match), or a re.MatchObject that contains information about the matching part of the string. This method stops after the first match, so this is best suited for testing a regular expression more than extracting data.
We can use re.search method like this to search for a pattern in regular expression:
```python
# Define a regular expression pattern
pattern = r"expression"

# Match the pattern against a string
text = "Hello, world!"

match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Match found!")
else:
    print("Match not found.")
```
## Searching for a pattern in re using re.findall() Method
You can also use the `re.findall` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in a string:


```python
import re
pattern = r"expression"
text = "The cat is in the hat."

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)
# Output: ['cat', 'hat']
```

### Replacing a pattern
The following example shows how to replace a pattern in a string:
```python
import re
pattern = r"[a-z]+at"
text = "The cat is in the hat."

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)

print(matches)
# Output: ['cat', 'hat']

new_text = re.sub(pattern, "dog", text)

print(new_text)
# Output: "The dog is in the dog."
```

### Extracting information from a string
The following example shows how to extract information from a string using regular expressions:

```python
import re

text = "The email address is example@example.com."

pattern = r"\w+@\w+\.\w+"

match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    email = match.group()
    print(email)
# Output: example@example.com
```
## Conclusion
Regular expressions are a powerful tool for working with strings and text data in Python. Whether you're matching patterns, replacing text, or extracting information, regular expressions make it easy to perform complex string operations with just a few lines of code. With a little bit of practice, you'll be able to use regular expressions to solve all sorts of string-related problems in Python.
