tup = (1,4,6, "Hello")
print(type(tup)) # <class 'tuple'>
print(tup) #v (1, 4, 6, 'Hello')


tp = (1)
print(type(tp)) # <class 'int'>
# So If you want to create tuple with one elemenent, You have to add a comma at the last.
tp = (1,)
print(type(tp)) # <class 'tuple'>

#Access tuple element
tuple = (10, "Hey", 20, "Aman")
print(tuple[1], tuple[3]) # Hey Aman

# All operation is same just like list
